# CHIP (Coastal Hazard Impact Planner)

This project is designed and built for the Cape Cod Commission of Barnstable County, Massachusetts and provides a public portal for communities of Cape Cod to assess, compare, and plan various strategies in response to the three major coastal hazards: storm surges, erosion, and sea level rise. 

It is divided into two main projects:

1. `ccc/chip_api` - a GraphQL API written in Elixir and using the Phoenix web framework and the Absinthe GraphQL library
1. `ccc/chip_app` - a Single-page App written in Elm and using the OpenLayers and Turf.js libraries for mapping and geospatial analysis

Architecture Decision Records can be found in `ccc/docs/architecture` and document the major architectural choices made throughout this project.
