# Architecture Decision Records
These documents reflect important architectural decisions made for OneWRAP. However, these documents are only reflecting decisions made from the time of this document's creation throughout the rest of the project's life.

Specifically, these documents will begin by focusing on decisions related to the front-end rewrite of the Professional & Public Viewers and the addition of SouthWRAP to the family.

Long term, all important architectural decisions should be documented here. The infrastructure directory will attempt to capture decisions made about the operational/infrastructure side of the project. The architecture directory will attempt to capture decisions made about the development and technology stack used by the project. 

For reference and to get caught up to speed on what ADRs entail, please see [this blog post by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
